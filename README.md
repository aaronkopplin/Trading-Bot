This program allows you to plot stock or crypto data, create your own technical indicators, and backtest trading strategies

To create a strategy, inherit from "Strategy.py". There is an exmaple strategy in "Strategy1.py"

Run your strategy with Ctrl + R

The rest should be pretty self explanatory.
